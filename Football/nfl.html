            <h2>Conferences</h2>
            <p>The NFL is split into 2 conferences the American Football League (AFC) and the National Football League (NFC). Being
                in one conference doesn't mean teams in the other conference don't play each other, just not as much based on a rotating schedule.
                Also location isn't based on conference at all.
                Teams play teams within their division the most and standings within a division help determine draft position and playoff position
                Each conferences is split into 4 divisions and has playoffs for conference champion. The two conference champions
                face each other in the Super Bowl every year.
